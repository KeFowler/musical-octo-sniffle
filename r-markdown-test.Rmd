# Ladybirds

Read in the ladybirds data, take a little look at it, then make a boxplot.
```{r}
library(dplyr)

ladybirds <- read.csv('ladybirds.csv')

str(ladybirds)

boxplot(number ~ Habitat, data=ladybirds)
```
Isn't it bland.

Hahaha
I hope your wonderful musical octopus recovers from their cold soon!
